# Creating Workshops

In this section, we are finally going to create our own workshops!

We will start with **bootstrapping** our **working environments**
and cover the basics of **writing Markdown-based instructions**,
before moving to more **advanced features** such as **setup scripts,**
**command blocks,** and **live-previewing** our changes.
